The Backbone Sample Code intends to show Synsoft's acquaintance with Backbone.js.
Although the pages dont really seem to do anything, they are being dynamically generated using backbone.js.
Please copy the entire code in a folder and making it a virtual directory, simply browse to the 2 html files (accounts.html, appointment.html) in it.
